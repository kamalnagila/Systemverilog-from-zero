Overview

This repository is a structured, concept-driven collection of SystemVerilog examples built with a design verification mindset.

The goal is not exhaustive syntax coverage.
The goal is to develop correctness, clarity, and reasoning skills required for professional DV environments and as preparation for UVM-based verification.

All examples are intentionally:

 Small and isolated
>> Easy to debug and reason about
>> Written to highlight why a construct exists, not just how to use it

Repository Objectives

>> Build strong SystemVerilog fundamentals relevant to design verification
>> Emphasize clean coding practices and predictable behavior
>> Establish a solid base before moving to UVM and constrained-random verification

Design Philosophy

>> Clarity over cleverness
>> Correctness over conciseness
>> Verification relevance over textbook examples

Where applicable, examples reflect patterns commonly encountered in:

>> Testbenches
>> Verification components
>> Pre-UVM environments

Current Status

This repository is an active work-in-progress.

Ongoing improvements include:

>> Refining examples for correctness and clarity
>> Adding verification-centric explanations
>> Improving documentation and folder organization

Intended Audience

>> Students preparing for Design Verification roles
>> Engineers revising SystemVerilog fundamentals
>> Anyone aiming to move toward UVM-based verification

Feedback

Technical feedback, suggestions, and review comments from verification engineers are welcome.

Note

This repository is built as part of a long-term learning and skill-building process, not as a finished reference library.
