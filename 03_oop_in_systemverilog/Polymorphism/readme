Polymorphism in SystemVerilog allows a parent class handle to refer to different child class objects and execute the correct method implementation at runtime.

This concept is fundamental to design verification and forms the backbone of UVM architecture

>> Key Concepts Covered

virtual methods in base classes

Method overriding in derived classes

Runtime method binding

Parent handle referencing child objects

Multiple child classes with common interfaces

Abstract base classes (pure virtual methods)

Transaction-level polymorphism (DV-oriented)
